Assingment - Smart Pointers

Assingment Requirements: 
  You need at least one unique_ptr, one shared_ptr, and one weak_ptr.  Demonstrate 
  when the pointers go out of scope and therefore the values are deleted.

  Hint: Use cout to print something to show when the pointers go out of scope and 
  therefore the values are deleted.  

  Using your own comments, comment each line of code with the exception of cout 
  statements unless it is at the top of a block of them.
